<!-- =================== -->
<!-- Explain difference between IAM user and IAM role in one paragraph. -->
An IAM user is a permanent identity for a person or application with long-term credentials (passwords/keys) for direct AWS interaction, while an IAM role is a temporary identity for services or users to assume, providing short-lived credentials for specific tasks, making roles more secure for service-to-service or delegated access without storing permanent keys, unlike users which are for direct, ongoing access
